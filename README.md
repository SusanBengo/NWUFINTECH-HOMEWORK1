Credit Suisse - Finance has Gone Wrong

## Overview and Origin

* Established in 1856 by Alfred Escher, the 19th-century industrialist looking to modernize Switzerland, set up the bank we know today as Credit Suisse (occasionally referred to as CS in this paper). From the jump, Credit Suisse was integral to the history of Switzerland. More specifically, their claim to fame in banking. To understand the magnitude of events over the last month or so, one must realize that banking (and perhaps Chocolate) is woven into the fabric that makes Switzerland great. Credit Suisse's wealth management division was an integral part of the country's identity and a significant contributor to the country's success. This despite lacking scruples banking every famous despot's and dictator's money, using unnamed numbered accounts, warts and all. 

#Business activities that led to problems

Credit Suisse is, at its core, a Private Bank. The Private Bank is perhaps the most critical cog at the center of the bank. It caters to ultra uber-rich individuals all over the World. In addition to helping protect and manage the wealth of these individuals, it also uses another cog, its asset management division, to invest its clients' funds, run their businesses, provide them with financing, arrange for IPO, and so on.  

Many of the World's wealthiest individuals have relationships with the banks in Switzerland. Given the historic secrecy laws that granted the rich much discretion, the Swiss Franc's relative stability coupled with the steadfast neutrality that Switzerland has shown through world wars, and global conflict, these banks have been seen as the safest havens for billions of funds. 

In Zurich, two banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, are often situated on the same high streets, on occasion next to each other. While Credit Suisse is (was) the junior bank of the two, it is often viewed as the Swiss National Bank, perhaps because of its name. Also, given that UBS is conservative and stodgy by nature with a measured approach to banking, including several control and guardrails, Credit Suisse is (was) seen as the 'sexier" of the two banks.

As luck might have it, Credit Suisse was barely impacted by the financial crisis of 2008. On the other hand, UBS was a bad boy; they had insider trading scandals and were bailed out. Consequently, they had to rehabilitate. Credit Suisse, on the other hand, chose to overlook most of the changes that many of its peers were forced to make by their respective regulators.

The Bank, Switzerland's second-largest lender, has experienced several years of trouble because of senior management change cycles, legal problems, and significant losses illustrated below.  While the bank started having some risk management issues in the early 2010s, the wheels came off publicly in 2019 when then CEO Tidjane Thaim hired his #2, a former EY audit named Iqbal Khan started to fall out. The details in financial papers were that Khan purchased a house next to his boss Thaim on the shores of Lake Zurich, which he demolished. He then built a massive mansion at all hours of the day, six days a week. Thaim retaliated by planting giant trees blocking Khan's view of Lake Zurich. Why is this important, you ask, because it nearly came to blows. As an acrimonious relationship developed between the two men, Iqbal Kahn was porched by UBS. As is standard in the industry, he wasn't supposed to start working at UBS for a few months (a.k.a gardening leave), so Credit Suisse hired a spy to follow him around Zurich. Mr. Khan noticed and confronted Credit Suisse about their un-Swiss-like behavior, leaving a bad taste in the public's mouth once leaked into the papers. This juvenile behavior led to the ousting of Thaim's, further destabilizing the bank's ongoing restructuring plan. Finally, the bank was put into the much safer hands of a Swiss native, former head of the very stable if boring Wholesale bank division, named Thomas Gottstein. Three weeks later. Switzerland went into lockdown because of Covid. So, while Gottstein had stated that he wanted to make 2021 a stable one for the bank, it turned out to be the most tumultuous for the CS in its 160-year history.

To summarize: the two mega scandals in 2021 were even more significant and relevant to the bank's business than Khan's Spygate. First, in March 2021, Credit Suisse persuaded its uber-rich clients to participate in Greensill Supply Chain funds, linked to a British-Indian industrialist, Sanjeev Gupta, and Softbank, the Japanese speculative financier. Most of the deals going down were above board. They included forged invoices and dodgy circular financing despite amassing 10 billion for their wealthiest clients. The promise that Greensill was a safe investment proved far from true. As such, when the funds unraveled, and the bonds Credit Suisse had persuaded their clientele to invest in through the Private Wealth division could not be paid back. Matters were made worse when Credit Suisse suspended the bonds, locking up 10 billion of their client's assets. Worse still, over twenty percent of the money remained unaccounted for after an audit. Through all these shenanigans with the Private bank, Credit Suisse's Investment Management arm courted Greensill by advising them on their planned IPO. 

As if this wasn't bad enough for the bank, another crisis started brewing in New York in July! Bill Hwang, CEO of a family office called Archegos, misled some of the largest and most sophisticated financial institutions into continually extending credit. According to people familiar with the matter, his deception left Credit Suisse with the most significant loss of all the banks involved, as well as the most significant loss in its history of approximately 5.5 billion. Regulators were concerned that the conflict of interest between the bank's core cogs, private banking, prime broking, and investment management, had spiraled out of control. Livid clients needed reassurance that the bank understood essential risk management. 

So as per usual, it was time for yet another CEO. This time, Sir Antonio Horta Osorio, knighted for turning Lloyd's bank around, was appointed because of his extensive experience.  Sadly he was a Portuguese gentleman and hence a non-Swiss leader who was bound to clash with the board and other people of influence within the bank once again. Like Thaim, Antonio enjoyed the jet set life a little too much. Considering the bank's core business, private banking, has not made any inroads in Portugal, it was fair to conclude that he took the company jet once too often to visit his family in Lisbon. Moreover, at the height of the Covid pandemic, he flew to London to watch a Wimbledon match followed by the European championship, which violated the COVID laws in the UK, so he too ultimately had to go.  

The year 2022 proved a major disappointment as well. A few more scandals and scams were uncovered in Mozambique and Bulgaria. Swiss leaks data dumps linking the bank to oligarchs, criminal organizations, and child traffickers lay bare the lack of scruples and risk management controls. All too much to detail here.  

Credit Suisse leadership finally had to admit that this was not a case of a few bad apples or individual mistakes but a systemic matter that coursed through the veins of the bank in the form of unnecessary risk-taking and the lack of guardrails and crucial controls to run a trusted banking institution. Yet another new Swiss leader Axel Lehmann the new chairman of the bank, acknowledged that they needed to change the culture of the whole organization. A mere ten months would lapse before the lid blew right off the pot in March 2023!


## Business Activities

# Current problem at hand:

Nearly fifteen years after the start of the 2008 financial crisis, an eerily similar sequence of events transpired at Bear Stearns; state regulators and banks scrambled over a weekend to save Credit Suisse. The buyer this time was UBS, not JP Morgan. The difference was that the price while higher at USD 3.25 billion (3 billion Swiss francs), was only 40% of what the bank had been worth when the markets closed the previous week. As with Bear, the deal was done at the government's request through its governing regulators to limit any contagion by the wider Europen banking sector and instill trust in Credit Suisse's clientele and Banking, a primary and vital industry to the Swiss economy.

While the global ultra-uber-rich hold accounts in the swiss banks, the emerging super-rich in Asia is a critical segment that the New Co. (UBS-CS) must stand ready to save to retain the top spot in Private Wealth Management. This week the swiss have shown that they still deem banking a critical sector in their economy by forging the 4th largest bank in the World. They will no doubt continue to use their multi-service concierge offering shroud in secrecy to bring their clients back on side. Like many banks, the newly merged bank will work to roll out best-in-class trade capture, prime broking, risk management, client reporting, commercial banking self-service online tools, and personal private banking ala carte services to their clients as differentiators. They will also become the largest bank in the European Union, trouncing their European counterparts such as Barclays and Deutsche Bank and perhaps forcing renewed efforts in innovation and consolidation globally.

## Landscape

Credit Suisse is a global bank engaged primarily in the financial services sector's private wealth, Investment Banking, Banking Advisory, prime broker, Wholesale Banking, and Retail Banking subsectors.

Banks continue to find ways to engage in fintech, cryptocurrency, and virtual banking to compete with the new stream of decentralized financing disruptors. In this effort, they are pursuing new builds (i.e., Goldman Sach Marcus offering and JPM's virtual bank).  As an alternative approach, they use their deep pockets to acquire promising start-ups at market prices.  The banks have also moved a number of their services, including but not limited to institutional trading, cash management, margin calls, and reporting to the web, for ease of use, as opposed to the previously restricted interfaces that could only be performed in the office. 

The global banking industry comprises prominent international players such as JPM, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Barclays, Nomura, BNP Paribas, Societe General, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Credit Suisse, MUJF, Sumitomo, Wells Fargo, Deutsche Bank, and HSBC. Several solid regional players, including the Canadian, Scandinavian, Spanish, Japanese, Australian, Singaporean, Chinese, and UK banks, round out the group to approximately 50.


## Results

Chronic underperformance and numerous scandals that Credit Suisse has experienced over the years took their toll and ultimately led to its demise in March 2023.


Key metrics that banks rely on are highlighting their profitability, risk management controls, trust from their clients, regulatory stress test, and increasing stock prices. They also compare key accounting ratios across competitors with similar business strategies, many of which Credit Suisse trailed in recent months compared to its peers.


Credit Suisse failed to perform to its plan, let alone well against its competitors. Several scandals with repetitive themes overrode its financial performance and weakened the bank's position in the financial services industry


## Recommendations

- I would advise the New Co (UBS-Credit Suisse), now the fourth largest bank by assets with 120,000 staff and 5tn in assets under management- to address the available staffing issue head-on. 

- The joint bank has several duplicate positions that must be culled. The sooner they conduct this exercise and move to retain solid performers with retention packages, the better off their transition will be. 

- I would recommend force-ranking individuals within their existing teams and then picking a group with the most potential going forward. Also, audit and assess all technology platforms and adopt the best one for the nearly formed organization. 

- Integrate portions of the runner-up that enhance the look and feel for internal users and external clients (web-facing trade booking interfaces, client reporting UI, or other web servers).

- Pick the concierge services that best caters to their joint private banking clientele. Perform thorough audits on clients and turn away any that do not meet their solid standards.

- Offer products that will help them retain their ultra-rich clients across both organizations so that they are not tempted to look elsewhere

I think the changes outlined above would go a long way to rebuilding the Swiss banking sector's well-earned trust in Switzerland and, indeed, around the globe.  All the changes rolled out over the short term need not introduce new technological changes but rather utilize the best-in-class technology they have on hand from both banks. Once done, the newly amalgated bank should consider conducting a gap analysis before weaving in new technology because it is now really too big to fail.
